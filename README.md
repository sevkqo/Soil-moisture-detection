# Soil-moisture-detection
This project contains Arduino code, which receives data from sensors of soil moisture and two Python codes. The first one receive data from Arduino via USB and send data to the Google Sheets file. The second one gets data from Google Sheets file and, if soil moisture is too low, Discord bot will send notifications about it.
